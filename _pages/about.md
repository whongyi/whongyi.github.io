I'm an Assistant Professor of Computer Science at [NYU Shanghai](https://shanghai.nyu.edu/). Prior to that, I received my Ph.D. in Information Science from Cornell University advised by [Deborah Estrin](https://destrin.tech.cornell.edu/). I hold a B.Eng in Computer Science from Tsinghua University. 

My research interest lies in developing human-in-the-loop machine learning systems and improving long-term values of personalizations. I lead the [<b>M</b>ultimodal <b>A</b>gentic <b>P</b>ersonalization <b>S</b>ystems (MAPS)](/MAPS-research) research group at NYU Shanghai. Our recent work focuses on Generative Models and their applications in Personalizations for Learning and Creativity. 

üì¢ I'm looking for PhDs to join our research group. Check our [PhD program](https://shanghai.nyu.edu/academics/graduate/computer-science-phd-program) and contact me at <u>hongyi.wen@nyu.edu</u> if you are interested in the following topics:
- Understanding Generative Models(LLM, Diffusion, etc) and making them more personalized for individual users
- AI for Learning and Creativity, especially for educational purposes
